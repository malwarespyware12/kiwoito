Private safari in Tanzania allows travelers to explore the country at their own pace, exactly the way they want. If you prefer to watch birds most of the time, start your safari day very early, or swim at the lodge, it is all up to you. You will have a private 4*4 Jeep and a professional private safari guide. So, no compromises. If you like to stop at a waterhole to watch the lions for two hours… that’s possible, or if you mainly wish to see the wildebeest migration, your guide can focus on that. A private safari allows you to explore Tanzania’s beautiful nature, wildlife, and culture on your terms.
